You should have a signing ssh-key attached to your git remote repo hosting (github, gitlab, etc. (end of thinking capacity)) to use this utility.
Just add your key to your ssh-agent and clone your steam saves repo via ssh like this: git@github.com:sisv1der/steam-saver.git.
That is required because I am too lazy to create another method.
